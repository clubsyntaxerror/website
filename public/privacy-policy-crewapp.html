    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 15, 2026</p>

    <p>
      Syntax Error Events ("the App") is operated by Svenska
      Spelmusikfrämjandet, a non-profit organisation based in Sweden. This
      policy explains what data we collect, why, and how you can control it.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      When you sign in with Discord, we receive and store the following
      information:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Data</th>
        <th>Source</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Discord user ID</td>
        <td>Discord OAuth</td>
        <td>Identify your account</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Discord username / display name</td>
        <td>Discord OAuth</td>
        <td>Show your name on task signups</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Discord email</td>
        <td>Discord OAuth</td>
        <td>Identify your account</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Discord avatar URL</td>
        <td>Discord OAuth</td>
        <td>Display your profile picture in the app</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Discord server roles</td>
        <td>Discord API (via our server)</td>
        <td>Determine your access level (crew / volunteer)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Task signups</td>
        <td>Created by you in the app</td>
        <td>Track which tasks you have volunteered for</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect your password, location, contacts, or
      any device identifiers.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your data is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate you in the app via Discord</li>
      <li>Display your name and avatar to other crew members</li>
      <li>Record which event tasks you have signed up for</li>
      <li>Verify your Discord role to grant appropriate access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, profiling, or any
      purpose beyond operating the app.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      Your data is stored in <a href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</a>, a
      cloud database platform. All data is transmitted over HTTPS (encrypted in
      transit) and stored in a secured database with row-level security
      policies. Only authenticated users can access data, and users can only
      modify their own task assignments.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, or share your personal data with
      any third parties. Your data is only processed by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Discord</strong> &mdash; for authentication (governed by
        <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Discord's Privacy Policy</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supabase</strong> &mdash; for data storage (governed by
        <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase's Privacy Policy</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Visible to Other Users</h2>
    <p>
      Other crew members and volunteers using the app can see your Discord
      username, avatar, role, and which tasks you have signed up for. This is
      essential for coordinating event tasks as a team.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Your data is retained for as long as you have an account. Task signup
      records are kept for historical reference of past events. You can delete
      all your data at any time (see below).
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights &mdash; Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      You can delete all of your data directly from the app. This will
      permanently remove:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your user account</li>
      <li>All your task signup records</li>
      <li>All stored profile information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After deletion, no personal data is retained. You may also contact us to
      request data deletion manually.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      This app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
      data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal
      data, please contact us so we can remove it.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on
      this page with an updated date. Continued use of the app after changes
      constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
